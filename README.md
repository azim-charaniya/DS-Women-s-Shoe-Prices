About Dataset
About This Data

This is a list of 10,000 women's shoes and their product information provided by Datafiniti's Product Database.

The dataset includes shoe name, brand, price, and more. Each shoe will have an entry for each price found for it and some shoes may have multiple entries.

Note that this is a sample of a large dataset. The full dataset is available through Datafiniti.
What You Can Do with This Data

You can use this data to determine brand markups, pricing strategies, and trends for luxury shoes. E.g.:

    What is the average price of each distinct brand listed?
    Which brands have the highest prices?
    Which ones have the widest distribution of prices?
    Is there a typical price distribution (e.g., normal) across brands or within specific brands?

Further processing data would also let you:

    Correlate specific product features with changes in price.
    You can cross-reference this data with a sample of our Men's Shoe Prices to see if there are any differences between women's brands and men's brands.

Data Schema

A full schema for the data is available in our support documentation.
